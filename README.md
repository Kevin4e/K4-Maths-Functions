# K4 Maths Functions

# Usage
-  Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Kevin4e/K4-Maths-Functions/releases).
-  Depending on where you put the 'includes' and 'src' folders you will have to edit the `#include "function.h"`. Unless, if you use the same structure as this repository, then you won't have to edit anything.
-  This collection provides the following functions:
   * ### Factorial 
     Defined as:   ___n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * 3 * 2 * 1___
     You need to enter `fact(number)` to use this function.
     
   * ### Logarithm
     Defined as:   ___a<sup>x</sup> = b <=> x = log<sub>a</sub> b___
     You need to enter `logarithm(base, argument)` to use this function.
    
   * ### Natural logarithm
     Defined as:   ___ln x = log<sub>e</sub> x___
     You need to enter `ln(argument)` to use this function.
     
   * ### Prime number check
     Verifies if a number is either prime or not (boolean)
     You need to enter `isPrime(number)` to use this function.

   * ### Multiples
     Prints all the multiples of 'n' with setting a limit
     You need to enter `multiples(number, max)` to use this function.
     
   * ### Divisors
     Prints all the divisors of 'n'
     You need to enter `divisors(number)` to use this function.
     
   * ### Root
     Defined as:   ___<sup>i</sup>âˆš(n) <=> a<sup>i</sup> = n___
     You need to enter `root(index, radicand)` to use this function.
