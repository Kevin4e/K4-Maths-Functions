# K4 Maths Functions

# Usage
-  Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Kevin4e/K4-Maths-Functions/releases).
-  Depending on where you put the 'includes' and 'src' folders you will have to edit the `#include "function.h"`. Unless, if you use the same structure as this repository, then you won't have to edit anything.
-  This collection provides the following functions:
   * ## Factorial 
     ___n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * 3 * 2 * 1___
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `fact(number)` to use this function.
     
   * ## Logarithm
     ___a<sup>x</sup> = b <=> x = log<sub>a</sub> b___
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `logarithm(base, argument)` to use this function.
    
   * ## Natural logarithm
     ___ln x = log<sub>e</sub> x___
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `ln(argument)` to use this function.
     
   * ## Prime number check
     Verifies if a number is either prime or not
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `isPrime(number)` to use this function.

   * ## Multiples
     Finds all the multiples of 'n' with setting a limit
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `multiples(number, max)` to use this function.
     
   * ## Divisors
     Finds all the divisors of 'n'
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `divisors(number)` to use this function.
     
   * ## Root
     ___<sup>i</sup>√(n) <=> a<sup>i</sup> = n___
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `root(index, radicand)` to use this function.
     
   * ## Greatest Common Divisor
     Finds the G.C.D. of 2 numbers
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `gcd(n1, n2)` to use this function.
     
   * ## Least Common Multiple
     Finds the l.c.m. of 2 numbers
     ## How to use?
     You need to enter `lcm(n1, n2)` to use this function.
     
   * ## Trigonometry functions
     A wide range of functions are offered here.
     ### sin(θ)
     The y-coordinate of the point of intersection between the terminal side of the angle θ and the unit circle.
     
   * ### Gamma function
   * ### Summation
   * ### Infinite product
   * ### Hyperbolic functions
