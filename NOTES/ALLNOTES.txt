	if (isPrime(n) ) {
	/*
		Instructions
	*/
	}

TRIGONOMETRY FUNCTIONS

	- Sine
	1. Any angle is valid.

	- Cosine
	1. Any angle is valid.

	- Tangent
	1. You cannot use angles that are equal to (k is an integer):
	   RAD:  π/2 rad + kπ rad.
	   DEG:  90° + k × 180°.
	   GRAD: 100 gon + k × 200 gon.
	   

	- Arcsine
	1. You cannot use values that are less than -1 or greater than 1.

	- Arccosine
	1. You cannot use values that are less than -1 or greater than 1.

	- Arctangent
	1. Any value is valid.


	- Cosecant
	1. You cannot use angles that are equal to (k is an integer):
	   RAD:  kπ rad
	   DEG:  k × 180°
	   GRAD: k × 200 gon

	- Secant
	1. You cannot use angles that are equal to (k is an integer):
	   RAD:  π/2 rad + kπ rad.
	   DEG:  90° + k × 180°.
	   GRAD: 100 gon + k × 200 gon.
	 
	- Cotangent
	1. You cannot use angles that are equal to (k is an integer):
	   RAD:  kπ rad.
	   DEG:  k × 180°.
	   GRAD: k × 200 gon.


	- Arccosecant
	1. You cannot use values between -1 and 1 (excluding -1 and 1).

	- Arcsecant
	1. You cannot use values between -1 and 1 (excluding -1 and 1).

	- Arccotangent
	1. Any number is valid.



GAMMA FUNCTION (Stirling's approximation)
1. This function has been approximated via Stirling's formula, hence results may lack full accuracy;
2. You cannot use negative values, as the approximation involves the value inside of a square root, which is undefined when for negative values.

	- Hyperbolic arccosine
	1. You cannot use values less than 1.

	- Hyperbolic arctangent
	1. You cannot use values less than or equal to -1 or greater than or equal to 1.
